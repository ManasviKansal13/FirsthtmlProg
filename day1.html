    <p>The human body is like a kingdom and The soul is its king.But there is a king of all the kings and that is the
        Supreme Power – God. This is the real beauty of the entire universe.<br> That is the basis of the universe – and it
        is like the thread of the garland where you can see the flowers or beads but not the thread which is holding all
        of them together. In the <b>same way one can see everything but not the one which is</b>  holding them intact.</p>
